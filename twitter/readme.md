# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Subha Mostafiz**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Twitter** is an android app that was riddle with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üòÄüßêü•≥**
